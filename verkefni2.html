										<h1>Project 2 - Laser cut table for Suzuki Jimny</h1>
									</header>
									
									<div class = "inner1">
										<p>Project 2 was to create something with laser cutter and vinyl cutter. I created a table for the tunnel console of my car, a Suzuki Jimny with the laser cutter and an Audi logo with the vinyl cutter.</p>
									<h2>Kerf test</h2>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/verkefni_2/measurement of the cutted squares.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/verkefni_2/laser_cutter_in_action.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>To define how much kerf, the laser cutter I was going to use I had to do a kerf test. I did 
										the kerf test with Jónas Þór and Tómas Ingi. For the kerf test we had to cut out 10 squares
										 and measure the difference in length of the squares cut out and put together and hole that
										  was created in the sheet plastic the squares were cut out of.</p>

									<p>On the right side of the page you can see the laser cutter in action as well as the measurement of the squares.</p>
									<p>The hole in the sheet plastic measured 9.82 mm and squares cut out combined measured 9.69 mm. Therefore, since 
										there where 11 cutting lines the laser cut between the squares, the kerf is (9.9-9.69)/11 = 0.019 mm.  </p>
									<p>Therefore I would have to offset all geometry by 0.0095mm to get accurate sizes. </p>

									<h3>Measurements</h3>
									<p>Before I started modeling the table in Inventor, I measured the tunnel console of the Jimny with vernier caliper. These are the mesurements I made:</p>
									<table>
										<thead>
											<tr>
												<th>Variable</th>
												<th>Mesurement</th>
												<th>Length</th>
											</tr>
										</thead>
										<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>H<sub>front</sub></td>
												<td>Height of tunnel console at the front</td>
												<td>60 mm</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>H<sub>rear</sub></td>
												<td>Height of tunnel console at the rear</td>
												<td>80 mm</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>W<sub>front</sub></td>
												<td>Width of tunnel console at the front</td>
												<td>150 mm</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>W<sub>rear</sub></td>
												<td>Width of tunnel console at the rear</td>
												<td>170 mm</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Length</td>
												<td>Length of tunnel console</td>
												<td>160 mm</td>
											</tr>
										</tbody>

									<h3>Parametric "top to bottom" Assembly</h3>
									<p>I used Top to bottom method in creating the table combined with parametric desing. You can watch tutorials
										 about how that works in the video here below. There you can see how to create and position a part in top to bottom assembly.  </p>
									
									<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S4MK9A2gPIU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>

									<p>Then I combined the top to bottom method with parametric design were I used driven dimensions from the main part to be able to scale the table if I had to. This video below shows how to access parameters in Inventor. </p>
									<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52iHEMOAq4Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									<p>This is how the parametric table looked in the assembly:</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/verkefni_2/parametrc_table.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>You notice that parameters in parts are gray which means that I am not able to modify them
										 in the parametric table in the assembly.
										I could have made link to the assembly for the parameters but it was quicker to create
										parameters in parts and then link to that part when using the same parameter in other
										 parts. This created a daisy chain between parts were I had to go to the source part
										  for each parameter to modify. The parametric tabel holded information about in which
										   part the parameter was first created.</p>
									

									<h3>Workflow</h3>
									<p>The table was pretty simple to do. I stated with an empty assembly in Inventor. There, I began by creating a part, in which I created the tabletop by doing a 2D sketch and then extrude it by
										 its thickness. Then I created the pressfit joints on the tabletop. I mirrored the pressfit joints about both x and y axis. Then the tabletop was finished.</p>
									<p>Next, I did the side plates of the table. I also did them by doing a 2d sketch and then extrude it by its thickness. To expess the sketch work, I used a feature called
										 project geometry which I used to create the outlines of the tabletop in. When I had created one side part, I mirrored it about the origin to place the side plate on both sides.</p>
									<p>I followed the same workflow when creating the front and back plates, by doing a 2D sketch, project geometry of other parts to the sketch and extrude the plates by its thickness. 
										But since the height of the tunnel console was more at the back than at front, I had to create two plates.   </p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Checking if the table fitted</h2>
									<p>In project 3 I had to 3D scan an object. To make sure the table fitted correctly to the tunnel console, I took pictures of the tunnel console and converted them into a 3D feature using meshroom. You can read about that <a href = "verkefni3.html#ref">here</a>. </p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/verkefni_3/Inkedjimni_meshroom_markup.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Flattening the assembly</h2>
									<p>When the assembly of the table was finished, I took all the parts created in that assembly and added to new assembly, in which I created a 2d sketch of a 500 x 500 mm rectangle. That was the size
										of the plate I was going to cut the table out of. Then, I flushed all of the parts to that sketch and puzzled the them together to fit inside the rectangle. You can see how I puzzled the parts
										 inside the rectangle in the picture below. </p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/verkefni_2/flatt_assembly.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Then I accessed the sketch of the rectangle and projected the parts to that sketch with project to geometry feature in Inventor. From there, I used offset loop and offsetted all lines
										outside by half the kerf. You can see how to offset loops in this video here below. </p>
									<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6J42SmomJZM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									<p>When I had offsetted the whole sketch, I exported the sketch to .dxf-file by right clicking the sketch in the folder tree on the left side of the sketch area in Inventor and select export sketch as.
										 There, I selected save to .dxf file. </p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Setup in Inkscape</h2>
									<p>
									When the sketch had been exported, I opened the .dxf file in Inkscape. There, I had to change the linewidth to 0.02 mm for the laser cutter. I did that by clicking ctrl+A on the keyboard,
									 go to fill and stroke on the right side of the screen, then click stroke style and there I could change the linewidth. Then I had to change the paper size by going to File => Document Properties and change widht and height to 500 x 500 mm.
									 When that was finished I clicked Ctrl+P, and selected the laser cutter in the printing window. </p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Laser cutting the table</h2>

									<p>The plates I was going to cut the table out of were made out of polymethyl methacrylate and 3x500x500 mm. When I selected print in Incscape, a software for the laser cutter popped up. 
										There, I could position the cutting lines to the plate I was going to cut out of. That was done in the center window, see the picture below. Then I set the autofocus to thickness, set
										 the speed to 20%, power to 100% and frequency to 100%. Finally I had to specify the thickness of the plate and click print. When I had selected print, the laser cutter was ready. 
										 Then I had to turn on the vacum for the cutter and press play on the laser cutter itself. The big green button on the picture below the monitor. </p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/verkefni_2/laser_cutSoftware.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/verkefni_2/laserCutter.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<h3>Problems</h3>
									<p>
									I noticed when the laser cutter was printing that it cutted every line twice. Then I figured it out that the sketch I imported into Inkscape from Inventor still had the geometry I created
									 the offset from which did not take kerf into account. The good thing was that the laser cutter could be stopped though it hadn´t finished so I stopped it to save material so I could use 
									 the same plate again one I had fixed the sketch. I could do that in Inkscape, which I did by deleting the lines there, that were not meant to be in the cutting route. Once, that was fixed, I printed the table. </p>
									<p></p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>The result</h2>
									<p>This is the final result. The table was stable and fitted well to the tunnel console.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/verkefni_2/result.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<h2>Creating a Audi logo sticker with vinyl cutter</h2>

									<p>I wanted to make a Audi logo for my car (which isn´t an Audi &#128517;). I began by searching the internet for an Audi logo
										 and finally found one from this website <a href = "https://www.cleanpng.com/png-audi-a3-car-logo-audi-type-ss-audi-logo-5144733/download-png.html"> Clean PNG</a> </p>
									
									<p>I then imported that to InkScape. The logo contained a background which I removed with the commands Path => Trace Bitmap... => Multicolor
										 => Remove Background => Apply. </p>
										 <p>I then had to remove the fill in the logo and did that by doing the commands: Shift+Ctrl+F => Fill and stroke => Fill => No fill</p>
										 <span class="image main"><img src="images/verkefni_2/incscape_audi_logo.png" alt="" /></span>
								
									
									<p>When I had removed the fill I resized the image to 100X70mm from the original size with the command Ctrl+A => Width = 100 and
										 had the aspect ratio locked by clicking on the lock next to the width input box. I then defined the linewidth 0.02 mm for the printer
										  and saved the file to .svg format. </p>
									<p>Then I had to move the .svg file to another computer in the fablab which was connected to the vinyl cutter. From that computer I checked 
										if the size was correct on the picture as well as the line width, and printed the logo to .pdf file. When that was done I placed the vinyl 
										in the cutter, adjusted the little wheels that holded the vinyl in place and tightened them to the vinyl. Then I opened the audi logi in
										 .pdf-viewer and printed it with the vinyl cutter. It´s name was Roland. When I had selected the right priner I had to set the width and
										  height of the printing space and then press print. The final result can be seen in the picture below:</p>
										  <span class="image main"><img src="images/verkefni_2/audi_in_place.jpg" alt="" /></span>
